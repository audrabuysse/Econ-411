I would like to do my project on wealth inequality. I think it would be interesting to look at wealth inequality in different countries and compare them. I would like to compare developed countries versus non-developed countries. I also think it would be interesting to see how the wealth inequality changes over time. I have found one potential dataset for this. This dataset allows you to choose certain information that you would like to view.
